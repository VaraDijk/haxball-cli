# haxball-cli

haxball-cli is a Python script that simplifies the process of loading JavaScript room in Haxball Headless using the Pyppeteer library, without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Requirements

To run this code, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Pyppeteer library (`pip install pyppeteer`)
- A web driver for the browser you want to use (e.g. ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver, etc.)

You also need to have a valid `config.json` file with the path to the web driver executable. An example `config.json` file is provided in the repository.
